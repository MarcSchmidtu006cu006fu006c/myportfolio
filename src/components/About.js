          As you might already be aware my name is Marc 
          Schmidt and I do stuff with computers. I currently 
          live in Calgary but Iâ€™m always willing to relocate 
          when an opportunity becomes available. In my free time 
          I like to fly fish and mountain bike in the summer as 
          well as ski and play hockey in the winter. I enjoy 
          software development because I think of it as almost 
          like mental carpentry where a problem is given and a 
          solution must be found. I enjoy learning new things 
          and I alway to try to have something new that I am 
          in the process of coming to grasp with whether that 
          is a new development language or an entirely new technology.
